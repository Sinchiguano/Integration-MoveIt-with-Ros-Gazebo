# Integration-MoveIt-with-Ros-Gazebo
## In a nutshell 
This repository contains ROS packages necessary for building the integration amongst MoveIt, and ROS gazebo for the PR2 robot. 
As well as a class to save the joint values in a csv format.

# Realtime Multi-Person Pose Estimation
## In a nutshell 

It has an application about controlling a robotic arm in a real-time using the following pre-trained model:[Realtime Multi-Person Pose Estimation page link](https://github.com/ZheC/Realtime_Multi-Person_Pose_Estimation) in order to estimate the key points of the image getting through the web camera and then proceed with the movement of the robotic arm with 7-DOF of PR2 robot.
The codes were written in python and use ROS platform as a programming environment, and also the simulation can be displayed with the help of ROS Rviz................


I am still working on this repository... Next update is to work with pose estimation of the human hand in order to manipulate the gripper of my robot, everything would be in real time!!!!....... keep waiting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
